/*
    base class(animal) has at least one virtual function.so user cant use that class
    it has to point to a child class which uses that virtual function

    const override function is used to declare virtual function in child class

    basically - we do not want to show main class(animal) so we are putting virtual function it it

    that way - we will not be able to define main class and it needs a reference(child) class to point to.
