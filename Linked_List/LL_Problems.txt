Here are some easy Linked List problems you can try:

### 1. **Reverse a Linked List**
   Reverse the linked list so that the first element becomes the last, and the last becomes the first.

   **Example:**
   ```
   Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
   Output: 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1
   ```

---

### 2. **Detect a Cycle in a Linked List**
   Determine if a linked list has a cycle (loop) in it. A cycle occurs if a node's next pointer points to one of the previous nodes.

   **Example:**
   ```
   Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2 (cycle back to node 2)
   Output: True (since there's a cycle)
   ```

---

### 3. **Remove Duplicates from Sorted Linked List**
   Given a sorted linked list, remove all duplicates such that each element appears only once.

   **Example:**
   ```
   Input: 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3
   Output: 1 -> 2 -> 3
   ```

---

### 4. **Find the Nth Node from the End**
   Given a linked list, find the Nth node from the end of the list.

   **Example:**
   ```
   Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, N = 2
   Output: 4
   ```

---

### 5. **Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists**
   Merge two sorted linked lists into a new sorted list. Return the merged list.

   **Example:**
   ```
   Input: List1 = 1 -> 3 -> 5, List2 = 2 -> 4 -> 6
   Output: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6
   ```

---

### 6. **Delete Node in a Linked List**
   Given a node in a linked list, delete that node (you are given the node itself, not the head).

   **Example:**
   ```
   Input: Node with value 3 in the list 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
   Output: 1 -> 2 -> 4
   ```

---

### 7. **Find Intersection of Two Linked Lists**
   Given two singly linked lists, determine if they intersect. If they do, return the node where the intersection begins. Otherwise, return `None`.

   **Example:**
   ```
   List1: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
   List2: 5 -> 6 -> 3 -> 4
   Output: Node 3
   ```

---

### 8. **Add Two Numbers Represented by Linked Lists**
   Given two non-negative integers represented by linked lists, where each node represents a digit, add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

   **Example:**
   ```
   Input: List1 = 2 -> 4 -> 3, List2 = 5 -> 6 -> 4
   Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8 (342 + 465 = 807)
   ```

---

### 9. **Swap Nodes in Pairs**
   Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.

   **Example:**
   ```
   Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
   Output: 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3
   ```

---

### 10. **Palindrome Linked List**
   Check if the linked list is a palindrome.

   **Example:**
   ```
   Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1
   Output: True
   ```
